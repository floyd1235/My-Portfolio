    <p>Space exploration has always been fascinating. It gives us hope of finding something new. Humans have always been explorers. When people from old times didn’t know about unknown lands they were compelled to explore them. The idea of space exploration has a sense of mystery and excitement about it. We have achieved some of the goals but not all. Through our space probes we were able to find new planets stars and even galaxies.Space exploration should continue because it could help solve many problems on Earth, such as overpopulation and lack of resources. There are many reasons that space exploration should continue. <br><br> If Earth ever becomes too overpopulated or over polluted, then perhaps people can move to Mars. But not everyone agrees on the same thing but I believe that we should and should not spent money on space exploration and there are good reasons that I will explain later on why I agree on the pros and the cons of space exploration. In our history many great things have happened. We have been inventing and exploring things since day one. Many of these things that we discovered or invented. We thought would never be possible in earth's life time. But they exist now, today, they are used by almost every human being and there are many more incredible and unimaginable things to come and aid us in everyday life. One of the most interesting things to me would fall under Space exploration.</p>
